\title{Create a Summary Table for Ungrouped Descriptive Statistics}
\usage{
desc_false(
  data1,
  table_title = "",
  quali = NULL,
  quanti = NULL,
  round_quanti = c(1),
  round_quali = c(0, 1),
  var_title = "Variable"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{A data frame containing the dataset to summarize.}

\item{table_title}{A character string specifying the title of the table (default: \code{""}).}

\item{quali}{A vector of qualitative variables to include in the summary. These are variables that require
additional description, often due to poor definition (default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{quanti}{A vector of quantitative variables to include in the summary (default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{var_title}{A character string specifying the column header for variables in the table (default: \code{"Variable"}).}
}
\value{
A \code{gtsummary} object representing the formatted summary table.
}
\description{
This function generates a summary table of descriptive statistics for a dataset, focusing on both
categorical and continuous variables. Unlike \code{desc_true}, this function does not include grouping.
It provides options to customize the table's title and variable labels.
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{gtsummary} package to compute and format descriptive statistics:
\itemize{
\item Categorical variables are summarized with counts and percentages.
\item Continuous variables are summarized with the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median,
and interquartile range.
\item Missing data statistics are added, and the table includes custom formatting, such as bolded labels
for variable names and italicized levels for categorical variables.
}

The table can also include a count of non-missing values and missing value statistics.

\strong{Key Customizations:}
\itemize{
\item Variables are displayed in bold.
\item NA values are excluded from the summary statistics.
\item Statistical formatting is applied, with specific decimal precision for both continuous and categorical variables.
}
}

# Example usage:

  table_title = "Descriptive Statistics of mtcars Dataset",
  quali = c("cyl", "gear"),
  quanti = c("mpg", "disp", "hp"),
  var_title = "Variable Name"
